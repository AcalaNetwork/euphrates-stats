# Euphartes Stats Dune Dashboard
query management for https://dune.com/euphrates/euphrates-stats

### Setup
Generate an API key from your Dune account and put that in both your `.env` file and [github action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) (name it `DUNE_API_KEY`). You can create a key under your Dune team settings. *The api key must be from a plus plan for this repo to work.*

You'll need python and pip installed to run the script commands. If you don't have a package manager set up, then use either [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) . Then install the required packages:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Things to be aware of

ðŸ’¡: Names of queries are pulled into the file name the first time `pull_from_dune.py` is run. Changing the file name in app or in folder will not affect each other (they aren't synced). **Make sure you leave the `___id.sql` at the end of the file, otherwise the scripts will break!**

ðŸŸ§: Make sure to leave in the comment `-- already part of a query repo` at the top of your file. This will hopefully help prevent others from using it in more than one repo.

ðŸ”’: Queries must be owned by the team the API key was created under - otherwise you won't be able to update them from the repo.

âž•: If you want to add a query, add it in Dune app first then pull the query id (from URL `dune.com/queries/{id}/other_stuff`) into `queries.yml`

ðŸ›‘: If you accidently merge a PR or push a commit that messes up your query in Dune, you can roll back any changes using [query version history](https://dune.com/docs/app/query-editor/version-history).
